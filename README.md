# How to make this run:
## On Fedora Linux.

```bash
sudo systemctl start httpd
```

    - This starts the apache web server on the system on fedora (httpd)



```bash
sudo systemctl enable httpd
```
    - Enable command tells it to run the service on boot instead. No need to use the above command unless something is broken.
